      <h2>88rising is Double Happiness</h2>
      <p>
        88rising is a multimedia company that is built around the celebration of
        Asian artists and their culture. The company has artists ranging from
        Indonesia, China, Japan, and South Korea, with multiple artists being
        popular in their native countries as well as others. 88rising uses its
        media and signed artists to connect Asian cultures in an interesting way
        with otherwise uninterested fans. The founder, Sean Miyashiro describes as a "hybrid management, record label,
        video production and marketing company."
