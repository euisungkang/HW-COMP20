      <h2>What is 88rising?</h2>
      <p>
        88rising is a multimedia company that is built around the celebration of
        Asian artists and their culture. The company has artists ranging from
        Indonesia, China, Japan, and South Korea, with multiple artists being
        popular in their native countries as well as others. 88rising uses its
        media and signed artists to connect Asian cultures in an interesting way
        with otherwise uninterested fans. The founder, Sean Miyashiro describes as a "hybrid management, record label,
        video production and marketing company."

      “A lot of people are wondering, ‘What is 88rising, exactly? Is it a YouTube
      channel? Is it a management company? Is it a record label?’’ Miyashiro says
      from behind large mirrored sunglasses. “It’s actually everything. Our
      general ethos is that we want to push this shit forward. It’s not like,
      ‘Hey, we’re trying to change people’s perceptions of Asians.’ We’re just
      doing it by being alive.”
