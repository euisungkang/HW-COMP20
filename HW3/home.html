        LAVOSI improves the lives of Deaf children in Guatemala by providing
        high quality comprehensive education. LAVOSI provides an inclusive
        fully accessible school environment that promotes academic learning,
        social development, job readiness, dignity and acceptance as Deaf
        individuals through the use of Guatemalan Sign Language and
        understanding of Deaf Culture. We believe that language access and
        education are the keys to ending the cycle of Discrimination and
        poverty that too often negatively impact the Deaf Community.
        Empowering Deaf individuals has a significant impact on Guatemalaâ€™s
        Deaf Community. LAVOSI was founded and is led by a native Deaf
        Guatemalteco: Alvaro Ernesto De Leon Espinoza. Through hard work and
        determination he created a unique school that empowers Deaf children
        to face their future with a sense of hope and optimism. </p>
